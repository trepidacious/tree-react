Fixed create is a Transaction but not a user of STMOps, so depends only on the Id(s) and fixed data. Can be run concurrently and safely since it is completely identical on client and server. Can be either an Id[A] => A, or just an A, or a Guid => A, or maybe even a specific DSL where we can only create items, not read them, if needed.

Unsafe create - as per current system, you need to ensure you will do the same thing on client and server, or risk invalid Ids/Guids.

Safe create - as per current system, but when STMOps are run, calls to safe create are flagged - if there are any in the Transaction, it will be sent to the server but NOT provided to the client. The client will be "paused" - e.g. for UI, use a modal scrim to prevent editing, and reject any transactions the client produces anyway. When the transaction is acknowledged by the server, editing can continue. As long as this is used rarely it shouldn't be annoying, and it is only needed when we really need to use existing state to influence creation - in most cases a user will just want to create a new "blank" or fixed data item, e.g. on pressing a "new item" button, rather than create something dependent on existing data.
